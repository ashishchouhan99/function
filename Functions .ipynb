What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","  - A function is a block of code defined using the def keyword that can be called independently.Whereas,\n","  - A method is a function that is defined within a class and is bound to a class.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python\n"," - In python , function parameters are  variables that are used to act as placeholders that expect value when the function is called.\n"," - Function arguments are the actual values that are passed when the function is called .\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","- In python we can define functions using def keyword . we can also make anonymous functions which are called as lambda functions used for small functions . while defining functions we can pass normal parameters or default parameters or none at all .\n","- Function calling can be done using writing the name of function along with the arguments in parenthesis if the function is printing something.\n","if the function returns a value and we need to get that , we have to use print() statement to print the returned value as well .\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n","- In python return statement is used to associate a value to the function when it terminates . This value can also be used elsewhere . Return statement is used because the variables in functions are local hence while using them outside the function ,they will initially not hold any value to them .\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","- Iterators are objects the are used to iterate inside an iterable  variable whereas iterables are data types that hold values or data which can be iterated over to access them such as lists , dictionaries ,sets , etc..\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined\n","- Generators are a special type of iterator, defined using functions with the yield keyword.\n","- Unlike functions that return a single value and terminate, generators pause their execution after yielding a value and can resume from where they left off.\n","- They are defined same as any noraml function but instead of return statement we use yield statement .\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","- When expecting large amounts of data from function we choose a generator instead of regular function because a function wont terminate unless all the statements from the regular function are run and whole result data is obtained whereas the generator function will yield only one result data and will perform next iterable operation when its called again using next()\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","- In python lambda function is used when we need to execute a single expression or statement in a function . Since lambda functions have no name they are called as anonymous functions .\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python\n","- Map function in python takes two arguments , first being a function and second being an iterable .\n","- Map function will use the function on each value of that iterable and return a list if required .\n","10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n","- Map function will operate the function on each value of iterable and will provide answer for each operator.\n","- Reduce function will operate on each value of the iterable and give a singular value based on those operation.\n","- Filter function will operate on each value of iterable and will provide those value that satisfy the function provided.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XtupFQUQr__N"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#                          Theory Question 11\n","# idk how to insert images here in colab so i will explain here itself\n","# firstly when the reduce statement is used the function will take 47 as x and the 11 as y\n","# this will be then added and will be stored in x (58)\n","# then 42 will be take as y and will be added and again stored in x as (100)\n","#the 13 will be takes as y and added with x and total will be 113\n","\n","from functools import reduce\n","list1=[47,11,42,13]\n","sum1 = reduce(lambda x,y : x + y,list1)\n","print(sum1)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"wXulst_jr_FL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735398476873,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":420,"user":{"displayName":"Hariom Khete","userId":"01588551143058364332"}},"outputId":"a1d8c923-3f92-4a56-dd47-636295fa6c38"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["113\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#  Q1.
